OpenSource P2P server, the name by itself say everything. The idea behind OpenSource P2P server, written in JavaScript, is to reuse all others open source codes that exist on GitHub, or NPM and make a P2P network able to use all these codes and all unimaginable ressources than a computer can do.

TouTrix, the company behind this project, have a story. The OpenSource P2P server is born after a suspension at a big cloud company. TouTrix AdServer was down for more than 48 hours because, and I guess, they don't had time to answer. Everytime we were answering them, it took never less than 20 hours before getting an answer from them. Ton of dollars was lost, reputation lost. The revengence began.

We are calling all developers, small or big datacenters of the world to take seriously this project in their heart right now. OpenSource P2P server is what every programmer want to have and to use. 

Here is what we think of:

- The server is API, object and social network oriented.
- A web interface is available to navigation easily in the API.
- Modules configuration oriented. We should always write less codes and reuse.
- An IDE available to code locally or directly in the cloud with the P2P network.
- Share anything, easily.
- Use bitcoin blockchain to pay or get paid to provide CPU, storage, bandwith, use other API services, pay service, etc.
- Someone can easily host is own website with his PC computer and pay for a public IP and maybe some bandwith. The network should have a lot of competition and best price for anyone.

I think you get the point now. This network should be able to do anything.

Who can use this technology?

A search engine could use it to get a lot of compute resource to crawl or analyse at the best price.

An adserver is already using that technology to be independent of big companies without investing too much in infrastructure. The network healing by itself provide enough resources.

Codes will be uploaded shortly.
